                        <p class="leading-relaxed">Traveling post-pandemic is new for everyone. But understanding the ever-changing rules and regulations while dealing with the unknowns of traveling for the first time can make any business – or vacation – traveler a little weary. Booking travel through your TMC or travel agent has never been more important, and here are just five reasons why.

                        We Cut Out Hold Times. U.S. air carriers are seeing record volumes as restrictions lift, and travelers have been experiencing over two-, three- and four-hour wait times to reach a reservation agent at some of the nation's largest airlines. Did you know that even at our busiest, your travelers can reach a World Travel agent within minutes? Booking through your TMC or travel agent gets you access to priority support. Don’t be stuck at the airport counter with 100 other frustrated travelers. Simply call or text your travel agent and they will help you with any changes or requests you may have.

                        We Help You Understand the New Requirements. Vaccine passports, COVID tests, mask mandates... The new travel landscape can be confusing for even the savviest traveler. Your agents and TMC spend hours each day combing through any new or changed requirements. At World Travel, we have even taken the time to create a comprehensive webpage, WorldAlert360, for travelers to reference for all their post-COVID travel questions.

                        We Help with Duty of Care. If the past year has taught us anything, it is that knowing where your travelers are at all times is critical. While we sincerely hope the world never shuts down again, monitoring your travelers’ location isn’t just important, it’s imperative. Booking all travel (air, car, hotel) through your travel agent ensures you have access to all the important travel data. In addition to proprietary technology solutions like WorldWatch, WorldAlert360 and WorldHub systems, our team also offers 24/7/365 support through our after-hours staff and award-winning online help desk. Agents use systems such as FlightGlobal to anticipate itinerary disruptions and delays before they affect the travelers’ journey and make changes when necessary.

                        We Help with Unused Tickets. Unused tickets... you probably came out of the pandemic with quite a few of those, huh? When the pandemic began, airlines were dealing with an estimated global refund liability of $35 billion, according to Business Travel News.  Ensuring our clients were able to get access to those unused tickets funds was crucial for us. In addition to processing our clients' unused tickets promptly to ensure that applicable waivers and valid tickets were used before expiry, we went to work enhancing our unused tickets reporting systems to reflect increased volume and feature additional metrics. We moved quickly to develop technology enhancements that provide accessible unused ticket information to travel managers and consultant teams.
                        We Can Save You Money.  Gone are the days of $58 tickets to Florida. Airports and airplanes are full once again, and since many airlines still haven’t gone back to their pre-COVID flight schedule, rates are going up. Booking with your travel agent, or even your online booking tool, gives you access to many options to ensure you and your travelers are getting the best value for their trip.
                        So, leave the travel arrangements to us because it’s what we do best. That way, you’re free to focus on a safe and successful return to travel.</p>

                        <p class="leading-relaxed">Meetings are back! Las Vegas is set to host its first large-scale meeting and tradeshow in June 2021. But as many planners already know, events in 2021 will look much different than they did two years ago. So how do you plan an event for the “new normal”? What key considerations should you take into account when you begin the process? We asked the team here at World Meetings & Events to provide some insider tips to help you ensure a successful - and healthy - event!

                        Virtual... Hybrid... In-Person... How Do I Choose?
                        It’s such a tough decision, and one you need to take seriously. For many of our clients, we have found using a simple survey during the planning phase has been extremely helpful. Right now, you will likely find your attendees want a hybrid model, but make sure you ask. They might surprise you and everyone may want to get back out and come in-person.

                        There is no single solution when encouraging attendees to attend an in-person event. Everyone has their own level of comfort, so communication is key. Having safety protocols in place is paramount and communicating your protocol and procedures to attendees and should be completely transparent. Using a mobile app is a great tool to inform attendees of your safety protocols, policies, hotel information, and adding an FAQ page can provide even more information to help your attendees feel secure. You should also have a plan of action in place to deal with an attendee or staff member who is non-compliant and a risk.

                        Safety (Keeping Your Distance)
                        Addressing the pandemic could help lessen anxiety. Make everything you can contactless. Develop a touchless check-in procedure. Are masks mandatory? Are vaccinations required to attend? Are you having temperature checks? Be sure to clearly communicate all safety procedures and cleaning protocols with everyone. Educate your attendees of the expectations and be sure to design your event with COVID protocols in mind. Perhaps even consider having your attendees sign a code of conduct prior to the event.

                        Offer plenty of sanitizing stations. You can even consider using color wristbands or lanyards to indicate each attendee’s personal social distancing preference (i.e., 6ft, elbow bump, hug). Communication is key, make sure to have plenty of signs on easels and not just stickers on the floor to control the flow.

                        Food & Beverage (Thinking Inside the Box)
                        Gone are pitchers of water, iced tea, and bread baskets. In their place are covered drinks, individual appetizers, and boxed lunches. Chefs are getting creative using individually wrapped snack boxes, bowls, bento boxes and jars. This also helps reduce lines and reduce the risks associated with “high-touchpoint” buffet tables. Looking for healthy alternatives for breaks? Instead of a cookie cart in the afternoon, serve vitamin C juices or acai bowls packed with antioxidants.

                        Perhaps opt for a plated service and have servers bring meals directly to each attendee, it might be a bit more expensive, but this can help make your attendees feel safer during mealtime. Create a seating chart to map the space and pre-assign seating to ensure proper spacing, and weather permitting consider utilizing outside space. Make sure to allow more time for meals and allow plenty of time necessary to take a meal break safely and not be rushed. For large meetings, consider splitting the attendees into smaller groups and assign mealtimes or different dining locations.

                        A trend for beverage services are Zero-proof cocktails and meals that boost your immune system. Limiting alcohol encourages healthier habits. It can also reduce the risk of intoxicated attendees ignoring safety protocols and as an added bonus they’ll be more refreshed in the morning. Typically, nonalcoholic drinks are less expensive.

                        There are many ways to have a fulfilling event while keeping it safe. It might take more work and prep than it has in the past, but your attendees will be grateful for the thought you put into your event.

                        <p class="leading-relaxed">World Travel, Inc.’s EVP and Corporate Counsel, Maribeth Minella recently completed a trip to Hawaii. It was a last-minute trip and according to Maribeth, traveling to Hawaii was “a lesson in preparedness.” Executive Director of World Travel, Inc. Leisure Tanya Browne guided Maribeth through the details of travel during the pandemic, from local testing requirements to airport guidelines before the trip. Learn more about Maribeth’s experience and what to expect on your next trip below.

                        What did you have to do to initially prepare for the trip? (Ex. Did you have to isolate yourself for two weeks before or afterward? Did you have to take a COVID test?)
                        Hawaii has very strict and particular requirements, so any travel to Hawaii must be very carefully planned. Travelers should read and understand all the information made available to them at hawaiicovid19.com and travel.hawaii.gov. For example, the COVID test must be within 72 hours of the date and time of the traveler’s last leg of their journey. For example, if your trip includes a connection, the test must be within 72 hours of the day and time of your connection. Before departure, travelers must register at travel.hawaii.gov and upload their test results. Successful registrations will result in a line QR code, which will be scanned at the airport upon arrival. Travelers who skip this step will be delayed at the airport until they register and receive a QR code.

                        Did Hawaii have any restrictions that hindered your experience?
                        No, Hawaii has a low COVID case count, therefore they have strict, but manageable guidelines to keep travelers and staff safe. Before traveling to Hawaii, it’s best to be informed of the COVID guidelines and expectations by the state. Tanya was knowledgeable and informative of Hawaii’s guidelines and what I would expect. For example, travelers must have a negative Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) test, from one of the state’s trusted testing centers, within 72 hours of the last leg of their journey to Hawaii. If you do not, you will be subject to the state’s mandatory 10-day quarantine. Using one of the state’s trusted testing partners is a must. Even if a traveler has a negative NAAT test from a different laboratory, the results will not be accepted by the state and the traveler will be subject to mandatory quarantine.

                        How were the airports? Was the process quick and easy? Did the staff stick to the airport COVID friendly guidelines?
                        Yes, the airport was unsurprisingly less crowded, but certainly not empty. There are definite signs of recovery. The airport staff was very kind and mindful about social distancing, making hand sanitizer readily available and focusing on sterilization and cleanliness. It is very clear that every possible precaution was being taken.

                        There are a lot of concerns about traveling now, what were your concerns and how did your experience differ from your expectations? And what would you say to other travelers who have similar concerns?
                        I expected there to be questionable cleanliness practices in the airports, travelers and staff not wearing masks, or long lines at the airport with no regard to social distancing, but that wasn’t the case. As long as you stick to COVID-safety recommendations, travel is rather uneventful. The airport staff, airline personnel, and most other passengers are very careful. I did not sit next to anyone and the seats and bathrooms were very clean. Make sure you are prepared, wear a mask and take a common-sense approach, travel is not an issue.

                        What is available to do while in Hawaii? Were the restaurants, and hotels open and clean?
                        My trip was last minute, and I didn’t have the opportunity to do any sightseeing. However, the beaches were open for tourists and the events for snorkeling and whale watching groups were kept to a smaller number than usual. Many of the restaurants, resorts, hiking trails were open as well. Since they were less crowded, they’re quite enjoyable. Some travelers might be concerned about the cleanliness of the hotels, and restaurants, but all of them were very clean. The staff took heed to all safety regulations, wore masks, and thoroughly cleaned every room and table after use. As I said, as long as you wear a mask, follow the safety regulations and take a common-sense approach, travel is uneventful.

                        If you plan to travel, research your destination’s COVID-19 restrictions and contact our Leisure Department for your state approved testing partners.
